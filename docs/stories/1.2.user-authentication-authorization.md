   - Support password reset via secure email tokens (1-hour expiration)
   - Implement password history to prevent reuse of last 5 passwords
   - Provide password strength indicator during registration/changes
   - Lock accounts after 5 failed login attempts with progressive backoff

5. **Session Management & Security**
   - Implement secure session handling with Redis-based storage
   - Support concurrent session limits per user (configurable, default 3)
   - Automatic session timeout after 8 hours of inactivity
   - Device fingerprinting for suspicious login detection
   - IP address change detection with re-authentication requirement
   - Audit logging for all authentication events and security incidents

6. **Rate Limiting & Abuse Prevention**
   - Apply rate limiting on authentication endpoints: 5 attempts per minute per IP
   - Implement progressive delays for repeated failed attempts
   - Support IP-based blocking for suspicious activity
   - CAPTCHA integration for high-risk login attempts

- **Integration Tests**: 0 files
- **Security Tests**: 0 files  
- **Performance Tests**: 0 files
- **E2E Tests**: 0 files

**Test Quality Analysis:**
