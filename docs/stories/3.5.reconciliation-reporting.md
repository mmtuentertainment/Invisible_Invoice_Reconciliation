## Dev Notes

### Reporting Database Schema
- **daily_metrics table**: date (DATE), tenant_id (UUID), total_invoices (INT), matched_invoices (INT), exceptions (INT), avg_processing_time (DECIMAL)
- **vendor_performance table**: vendor_id (UUID), date (DATE), match_rate (DECIMAL), data_quality_score (DECIMAL), exception_count (INT)
- **matching_analytics table**: date (DATE), confidence_range (VARCHAR), match_count (INT), accuracy_rate (DECIMAL)
- **financial_metrics table**: date (DATE), tenant_id (UUID), cost_savings (DECIMAL), discounts_captured (DECIMAL), penalties_avoided (DECIMAL)

### Report Types & Templates
```python
class ReportType(Enum):
    DAILY_SUMMARY = "daily_summary"
    WEEKLY_PERFORMANCE = "weekly_performance"
    MONTHLY_ANALYTICS = "monthly_analytics"
    VENDOR_SCORECARD = "vendor_scorecard"
    EXECUTIVE_DASHBOARD = "executive_dashboard"
    FINANCIAL_IMPACT = "financial_impact"
    DATA_QUALITY = "data_quality"
    EXCEPTION_ANALYSIS = "exception_analysis"
```

# Key Performance Indicators
first_pass_match_rate = matched_invoices / total_invoices * 100
auto_approval_rate = auto_approved / total_matched * 100
avg_exception_resolution_time = total_resolution_time / resolved_exceptions
cost_savings_per_invoice = (manual_processing_time - automated_time) * hourly_rate
data_quality_score = (complete_fields + normalized_fields) / total_fields * 100
```
