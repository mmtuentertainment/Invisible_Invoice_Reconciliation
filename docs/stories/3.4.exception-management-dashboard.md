# Story 3.4: Exception Management Dashboard

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Epic:** 3 - 3-Way Matching Engine  
**Story:** 3.4 - Exception Management Dashboard

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As an** Accounts Payable Manager,  
**I want** a comprehensive dashboard to review and resolve matching exceptions efficiently,  
**so that** I can quickly approve legitimate matches, identify data issues, and maintain smooth AP processing flow.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Exception Queue Management**
   - Display all unresolved matching exceptions in a prioritized list
   - Sort exceptions by amount (high to low), age (oldest first), vendor, confidence score
   - Filter exceptions by status, date range, vendor, exception type
   - Show exception counts by type: No match found, Multiple matches, Outside tolerance, Missing data, Duplicates
   - Support bulk operations: approve, reject, reassign, mark for review

2. **Exception Detail View**
   - Show side-by-side comparison of invoice vs potential matches
   - Highlight differences in amount, dates, vendor names, PO numbers
   - Display confidence score with detailed breakdown explanation
   - Show top 3 most likely matches with similarity percentages
   - Present match algorithm reasoning and scoring factors

3. **Interactive Resolution Interface**
   - Provide quick approve/reject buttons for each suggested match
   - Enable keyboard shortcuts for rapid exception processing (A=approve, R=reject, N=next)
   - Support manual match creation by selecting from available POs/receipts
   - Allow adding notes and comments to exceptions for future reference
   - Enable escalation to supervisor or specialist roles

4. **Performance & Productivity Features**
   - Process individual exceptions in under 2 seconds
   - Support keyboard-only navigation for power users
   - Save custom filter combinations as named views
   - Auto-refresh exception list every 30 seconds
   - Show processing statistics: exceptions resolved per hour, average resolution time

5. **Exception Analytics & Reporting**
   - Display exception trend charts: daily/weekly/monthly volumes
   - Show exception types breakdown with root cause analysis
   - Track resolver performance metrics and processing times
   - Export exception data to CSV for external analysis
   - Generate exception aging reports for management

6. **Collaboration & Workflow**
   - Support assignment of exceptions to specific team members
   - Enable comments and discussion threads on complex exceptions
   - Track exception history with full audit trail
   - Send notifications for high-value or aging exceptions
   - Support escalation workflows for difficult cases

## Dev Notes

### Database Schema Requirements
- **exceptions table**: exception_id (UUID), invoice_id (UUID), exception_type (ENUM), status (ENUM), confidence_score (DECIMAL), created_at (TIMESTAMP), assigned_to (UUID), resolved_at (TIMESTAMP)
- **exception_matches table**: exception_id (UUID), match_candidate_id (UUID), similarity_score (DECIMAL), match_reasoning (JSONB)
- **exception_notes table**: note_id (UUID), exception_id (UUID), user_id (UUID), note_text (TEXT), created_at (TIMESTAMP)
- **exception_history table**: history_id (UUID), exception_id (UUID), action_type (ENUM), old_values (JSONB), new_values (JSONB), user_id (UUID), timestamp (TIMESTAMP)

### Exception Types Enum
```python
class ExceptionType(Enum):
    NO_MATCH = "no_match_found"
    MULTIPLE_MATCHES = "multiple_potential_matches"  
    OUTSIDE_TOLERANCE = "outside_tolerance_thresholds"
    MISSING_DATA = "missing_required_data"
    DUPLICATE_INVOICE = "duplicate_invoice_detected"
    DATA_QUALITY = "data_quality_issue"
    MANUAL_REVIEW = "flagged_for_manual_review"
```

### API Specifications
- **GET /api/v1/exceptions**: List exceptions with filtering/sorting/pagination
- **GET /api/v1/exceptions/{id}**: Get detailed exception information
- **PUT /api/v1/exceptions/{id}/resolve**: Resolve exception with decision
- **PUT /api/v1/exceptions/bulk-action**: Process multiple exceptions
- **POST /api/v1/exceptions/{id}/notes**: Add note to exception
- **GET /api/v1/exceptions/analytics**: Exception analytics and trends
- **POST /api/v1/exceptions/{id}/assign**: Assign exception to user

### Frontend Component Architecture
```typescript
// Main exception management components
- ExceptionDashboard (main container)
  - ExceptionFilters (filtering/sorting controls)
  - ExceptionList (table with bulk actions)
  - ExceptionDetail (detailed view panel)
    - ComparisonView (side-by-side comparison)
    - MatchSuggestions (top match candidates)
    - ResolutionActions (approve/reject/manual)
    - NotesPanel (comments and history)
  - ExceptionAnalytics (charts and metrics)
```

### Performance Optimization
- Virtual scrolling for large exception lists (1000+ items)
- Debounced search and filtering to reduce API calls
- Caching of exception data with smart invalidation
- Progressive loading of exception details
- Optimized database queries with proper indexing on status, created_at, assigned_to

### Security Considerations
- Role-based access control for exception resolution
- Audit logging for all exception actions and decisions
- Tenant isolation for exception data
- Rate limiting on bulk operations
- Input validation and sanitization for notes and comments

### User Experience Design
- Responsive design for desktop and tablet use
- Clear visual hierarchy with exception priority indicators
- Consistent color coding for exception types and statuses
- Loading states and progress indicators for bulk operations
- Tooltips and help text for complex matching explanations
