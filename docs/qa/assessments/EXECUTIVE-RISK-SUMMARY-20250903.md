## Decision Framework

### Proceed with Custom Implementation IF:
- [ ] Board accepts 8.1/9 risk level
- [ ] $550K additional risk mitigation budget approved  
- [ ] 18-month timeline acceptable
- [ ] Technical team has financial systems expertise
- [ ] External security and compliance audits arranged

### Choose Managed Services IF:
- [ ] 40% risk reduction valued over feature control
- [ ] Faster time-to-market is priority
- [ ] Long-term maintenance burden is concern
- [ ] Technical team prefers proven solutions

### Use Phased Approach IF:
- [ ] Risk tolerance is low
- [ ] Budget constraints exist
- [ ] Market validation needed before full investment
- [ ] Technical proof-of-concept desired first

## Conclusion

The Invoice Reconciliation Platform presents **CRITICAL RISK** levels that require executive intervention and risk acceptance. The combination of financial data handling, multi-tenant architecture, and complex business logic creates a high-stakes development environment.

**Key Decision Points:**
1. **Custom vs Managed**: Custom authentication adds 70% more risk
2. **Timeline vs Risk**: Aggressive timeline increases failure probability  
3. **Investment vs Return**: Risk mitigation adds 30% to budget but reduces 60% of risk
4. **Compliance**: External audits mandatory for financial system

**Final Recommendation:** 
**Adopt Option 2 (Managed Services Hybrid)** to balance functionality with risk reduction. The 40% risk reduction and 25% faster delivery significantly outweigh the loss of some custom features.
