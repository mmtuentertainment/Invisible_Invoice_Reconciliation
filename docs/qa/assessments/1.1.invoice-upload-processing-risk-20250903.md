  - Transaction boundary issues across systems
  - State synchronization challenges
- **Mitigation Priority:** P1

## Technical Debt Impact Assessment

### High-Risk Debt Areas:
1. **CSV Parser Complexity** - Custom RFC 4180 implementation vs battle-tested libraries
2. **Error Handling Scope** - 15+ different error scenarios require comprehensive handling
3. **WebSocket State Management** - Real-time progress tracking adds significant complexity
4. **Transaction Boundaries** - Atomic operations across multiple systems

### Debt Mitigation Strategy:
- Use proven CSV libraries (pandas/csv) instead of custom parser
- Implement circuit breaker pattern for external dependencies
- Add comprehensive integration test coverage
- Consider simplifying WebSocket requirements for MVP

## Regression Potential Scoring

### High Regression Areas (Score: 8/9):
- **File Upload Resumption** - Complex state management prone to edge cases
- **Error Recovery** - Rollback mechanisms difficult to test comprehensively
- **Multi-format Support** - Each new format increases regression surface
- **Performance Optimization** - Streaming changes could break existing functionality

### Regression Prevention Strategy:
- Implement comprehensive file format test matrix
- Add performance regression testing to CI/CD
- Create synthetic large file testing capabilities
- Build rollback verification test suite

## Specific Mitigation Strategies

### P0 Critical Mitigations:
1. **Financial Data Validation**
   - Implement decimal arithmetic library (not float)
   - Add checksums for amount validation
   - Build currency normalization test matrix
   - Create data corruption detection algorithms

2. **Security Hardening**
   - Integrate ClamAV or similar virus scanner
   - Implement file content type validation beyond extension
   - Add rate limiting per tenant (3 concurrent uploads)
   - Build malicious content detection patterns

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement streaming CSV parser with memory limits
   - Add database connection pooling monitoring
   - Build chunked upload verification mechanisms
   - Create load balancing for processing workers

4. **Tenant Isolation**
   - Add RLS policy testing for edge cases
   - Implement tenant-specific audit logging
   - Build data leakage detection tests
   - Create isolation boundary verification

### P1 Important Mitigations:
1. **Error Handling Robustness**
   - Build comprehensive error taxonomy
   - Add error recovery test scenarios
   - Implement graceful degradation patterns
   - Create error reporting verification

2. **Integration Resilience**
   - Add circuit breaker for external services
   - Implement retry with exponential backoff
   - Build system health monitoring
   - Create integration point testing

## Testing Strategy Recommendations

### Critical Test Categories:
1. **Boundary Testing** - File size limits, field count limits, character encoding edge cases
2. **Chaos Testing** - Network interruption, memory pressure, disk space exhaustion
3. **Security Testing** - Malicious file uploads, SQL injection via CSV, XSS in filenames
4. **Performance Testing** - Large file processing, concurrent upload limits, memory usage
5. **Compliance Testing** - Audit trail completeness, data retention, access controls

### Test Data Requirements:
- Synthetic 50MB CSV files with various formats
- Malicious file samples for security testing
- Edge case datasets (Unicode, special characters, malformed data)
- Performance baseline datasets for regression testing

### Test Environment Specifications:
- Production-like hardware for performance testing
- Multi-tenant test data for isolation testing
- Network throttling capabilities for upload testing
- Memory/CPU monitoring for resource testing

## Conclusion
Story 1.1 represents **CRITICAL FINANCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE** with significant inherent risks. The combination of financial data handling, file processing, and multi-tenant architecture creates a perfect storm of potential failures. 

**Recommendation: DO NOT PROCEED** without addressing P0 mitigation strategies. Consider reducing scope for MVP to minimize risk surface area.
