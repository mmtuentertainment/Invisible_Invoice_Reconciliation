## Testing Standards Enforcement

### 1. No Flaky Tests Policy
- **Deterministic Algorithms:** All matching results must be reproducible
- **Database State Management:** Tests create consistent database states
- **Timing Independence:** Tests don't depend on algorithm execution timing
- **Resource Isolation:** Tests don't interfere with each other's data

### 2. No Hard Waits Policy
- **Algorithm Completion:** Use callback/promise patterns for async matching
- **Database Operations:** Wait for transaction completion, not fixed time
- **Batch Processing:** Monitor progress events, not elapsed time
- **Performance Testing:** Use throughput metrics, not arbitrary timeouts

### 3. Stateless Test Design
- **Independent Matching:** Each test creates its own PO/invoice data
- **Algorithm State:** Tests don't depend on previous algorithm learning
- **Database State:** Each test starts with clean, known data state
- **Configuration Isolation:** Tests use isolated configuration settings

### 4. Self-Cleaning Tests
- **Data Lifecycle Management:** Tests create and clean up their own data
- **Algorithm State Reset:** Tests reset learning/confidence calibration
- **Database Cleanup:** Tests remove generated invoices/POs/matches
- **Cache Management:** Tests clear algorithm caches and intermediate results

### 5. Clear Assertions
- **Match Accuracy:** Explicit verification of correct/incorrect matches
- **Confidence Scores:** Specific confidence level assertions
- **Performance Metrics:** Clear performance benchmark assertions
- **Error Conditions:** Explicit error handling and message validation
