## Critical Focus Areas

### 1. Multi-Tenant Isolation Testing (P0 - CRITICAL)
**Risk Addressed:** Multi-tenant data breach prevention

#### Test Scenarios:
1. **JWT Token Tenant Claim Validation**
   ```
   AC1: Verify JWT contains valid tenant_id claim
   AC2: Verify tenant_id matches authenticated user's tenant
   AC3: Verify token signature validation prevents tenant_id manipulation
   AC4: Verify expired tokens are rejected across all endpoints
   AC5: Verify malformed tenant claims are rejected
   ```

2. **Cross-Tenant Data Access Prevention**
   ```
   AC1: User from Tenant A cannot access Tenant B invoices via API
   AC2: User from Tenant A cannot access Tenant B users via API
   AC3: SQL injection attempts cannot bypass tenant isolation
   AC4: Direct database queries respect RLS policies
   AC5: Admin endpoints require proper tenant override authorization
   ```

3. **PostgreSQL RLS Policy Validation**
   ```
   AC1: All tables enforce tenant_id-based row-level security
   AC2: RLS policies cannot be bypassed with SQL injection
   AC3: Performance impact of RLS is <5% vs non-RLS queries
   AC4: Tenant context is automatically set on all connections
   AC5: Admin override works correctly for support scenarios
   ```

#### Test Data Requirements:
- 10 synthetic tenant datasets with realistic user distributions
- Financial data samples across tenants for isolation testing
- JWT tokens with manipulated tenant_id claims
- SQL injection attack patterns specific to PostgreSQL RLS

### 2. Financial Controls Security Testing (P0 - CRITICAL)
**Risk Addressed:** Financial accuracy and authorization validation

#### Test Scenarios:
1. **Role-Based Access Control**
   ```
   AC1: AP Manager can approve invoices within authorization limits
   AC2: Regular users cannot access approval functions
   AC3: Viewers have read-only access to appropriate invoice data
   AC4: Role escalation attempts are blocked and logged
   AC5: Emergency access procedures work with proper audit trail
   ```

2. **Privileged Action Authorization**
   ```
   AC1: High-value transactions require additional authorization
   AC2: Bulk operations require supervisor approval
   AC3: Configuration changes require administrator privileges
   AC4: All privileged actions are logged with full audit trail
   AC5: Failed authorization attempts trigger security alerts
   ```

3. **Financial Transaction Integrity**
   ```
   AC1: Authentication failures prevent any financial data access
   AC2: Session hijacking cannot complete financial transactions
   AC3: MFA bypasses are impossible for financial operations
   AC4: All financial actions are traced to authenticated users
   AC5: Suspicious activity patterns trigger automatic lockouts
   ```

#### Test Data Requirements:
- User roles matrix with financial authorization levels
- High-value transaction scenarios requiring additional approvals
- Audit trail validation datasets
- Attack scenarios for session hijacking and privilege escalation

### 3. Security Penetration Testing (P0 - CRITICAL)

   ```
   AC1: JWT tokens cannot be forged without signing key
   AC2: Algorithm confusion attacks (none, HS256→RS256) fail
   AC3: Token replay attacks are prevented through expiration
   AC4: Refresh token rotation works correctly
   AC5: Token blacklisting works for logout scenarios
   ```

2. **Session Management Security**
   ```
   AC1: Session fixation attacks are prevented
   AC2: Session hijacking detection and prevention works
   AC3: Concurrent session limits are enforced
   AC4: Session timeout works correctly across all scenarios

   ```
   AC1: TOTP bypass attempts fail
   AC2: Recovery code abuse is prevented
   AC3: MFA enforcement cannot be bypassed
   AC4: Device registration is secure and tamper-proof
   AC5: MFA reset procedures require proper verification
   ```

#### Test Data Requirements:
- Common JWT attack payloads and manipulation attempts
- Session attack vectors and exploitation techniques
- TOTP/MFA bypass attack patterns
- Network-level attack simulation datasets

### 4. Performance and Scalability Testing (P1 - HIGH)
**Risk Addressed:** System performance under realistic load

#### Test Scenarios:
1. **Authentication Performance**
   ```
   AC1: JWT validation completes in <100ms under normal load
   AC2: MFA validation completes in <500ms
   AC3: Session lookup performs in <50ms with 100K active sessions
   AC4: Rate limiting doesn't block legitimate users
   AC5: Authentication system scales to 1000 concurrent users
   ```

2. **Database Performance**
   ```
   AC1: User authentication queries complete in <100ms
   AC2: Role/permission lookups complete in <50ms
   AC3: Session storage/retrieval performs adequately
   AC4: RLS policy queries maintain <5% performance overhead
   AC5: Connection pooling handles concurrent authentication load
   ```

#### Test Data Requirements:
- Load testing scenarios with 1000+ concurrent users
- Large user databases (10K+ users) for scalability testing
- Performance baseline measurements
- Authentication load patterns based on realistic usage

## Testing Standards Enforcement

### 1. No Flaky Tests Policy
- **Async Handling:** All authentication tests use proper async/await patterns
- **Race Condition Prevention:** Tests wait for authentication state changes
- **Token Expiration Handling:** Tests account for JWT token timing
- **Session State Management:** Tests properly handle session lifecycle

### 2. No Hard Waits Policy  
- **Dynamic Strategies:** Use polling for authentication completion
- **Event-Driven Testing:** Wait for authentication events, not fixed timeouts
- **State Verification:** Verify authentication state before proceeding
- **Timeout Configuration:** Reasonable timeouts based on expected performance

### 3. Stateless Test Design
- **Independent Tests:** Each test creates its own users and auth state
- **No Shared State:** Tests don't depend on previously created auth data
- **Parallel Execution:** Tests can run concurrently without interference
- **Clean State Verification:** Each test verifies clean starting state

### 4. Self-Cleaning Tests
- **User Management:** Tests create and delete their own users
- **Session Cleanup:** Tests invalidate sessions they create
- **Token Management:** Tests clean up JWT tokens and blacklist entries
- **Database Cleanup:** Tests remove authentication artifacts

### 5. Clear Assertions
- **Explicit Verification:** Authentication success/failure explicitly checked
- **Error Message Validation:** Specific error messages and codes verified
- **State Assertions:** Authentication state changes explicitly validated
- **Audit Trail Verification:** Logging and audit entries explicitly checked
