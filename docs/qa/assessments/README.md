## Risk Assessment Methodology

### BMad Risk Scoring Framework (1-9 Scale)
- **1-2:** Minimal Risk - Standard development practices sufficient
- **3-4:** Low Risk - Basic mitigation strategies recommended
- **5-6:** Medium Risk - Comprehensive testing and monitoring required
- **7-8:** High Risk - External validation and enhanced controls needed
- **9:** Critical Risk - Executive approval and specialized expertise required

### Risk Calculation Formula
**Risk Score = (Probability Ã— Impact Ã— Complexity) / 10**

Where:
- **Probability:** Likelihood of risk realization (0.1-1.0)
- **Impact:** Business/financial consequence (1-10)
- **Complexity:** Technical and integration complexity factor (1-5)

### Evidence-Based Assessment Criteria
Each risk assessment includes:
- âœ… **Quantifiable evidence** supporting risk scores
- âœ… **Specific mitigation strategies** with implementation details
- âœ… **Financial impact analysis** with cost/benefit calculations  
- âœ… **Testing strategy recommendations** with success criteria
- âœ… **Regression potential scoring** with prevention strategies
